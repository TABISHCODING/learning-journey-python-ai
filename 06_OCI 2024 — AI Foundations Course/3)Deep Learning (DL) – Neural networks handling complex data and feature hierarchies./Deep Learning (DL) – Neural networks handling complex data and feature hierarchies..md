# 🧠 Module: Deep Learning — Foundations & Architectures

**Instructor:** Hemant — Senior Principal Training Lead, Oracle University
**Scope:** Foundations of deep learning, neural network building blocks, image and sequence model architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM), training basics and examples.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

* Define **deep learning** and understand how it differs from classical ML
* Describe components of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
* Know which architectures suit **image** vs **sequence** problems
* Explain training via **backpropagation** and why deep networks scale with GPUs
* Understand **RNN** and **LSTM** for sequence modelling

---

## 🔷 What is Deep Learning?

* **Deep Learning (DL)** is a subset of Machine Learning that trains **artificial neural networks** (many-layered) to learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw data (e.g., image pixels, audio waveforms, text tokens).
* DL **automatically extracts features**, removing the need for manual feature engineering for complex data.
* DL scales well with large datasets and parallel compute (GPUs → batch processing).

---

## 🧾 Short History & Milestones

* **1950s–1980s:** Concepts — artificial neuron, perceptron, backpropagation (1980s).
* **1990s:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) introduced for images.
* **2000s → 2010s:** GPUs became widely available → explosion of DL research and practical use.
* **2012:** AlexNet showed breakthrough in image recognition.
* **2016+ → today:** Growth in generative models (GANs, diffusion), transformers, LLMs.

---

## 🧱 Artificial Neural Network (ANN) — Building Blocks

* **Layers:** Input layer, hidden layers (one or many), output layer.
* **Neurons:** Computational units. Each neuron:

  * Receives inputs → multiplies by **weights** → sums → adds **bias** → applies **activation function** → produces output.
* **Weights & Biases:** Learnable parameters adjusted during training.
* **Activation Functions:** Add non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh).
* **Backpropagation:** Algorithm to compute gradients of loss w.r.t. weights and update them (gradient descent / optimizers).
* **Mini-batch training:** Data split into batches, processed in parallel; helps use GPU efficiently.

---

## ✅ Why use Deep Learning?

* Automatically learn complex, hierarchical features (edges → shapes → objects).
* Works well on **images, audio, video, text**, and mixed modalities.
* Enables powerful generative models (text, images, audio).

---

## 🖼️ Deep Learning for Images — Recommended Architectures

* **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**

  * Detects spatial patterns via convolution kernels, pooling, and hierarchical feature maps.
  * Best for: image classification, object detection, segmentation, facial recognition.
* **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) — single-shot, real-time object detection.
* **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** — generate realistic images.
* **Diffusion models** / transformers for modern text→image pipelines.

---

## ✍️ Example: Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST-style)

* **Input:** 28×28 pixel image → flattened or fed to CNN.
* **Architecture:** Input layer → hidden layers (e.g., conv + pooling) → dense layers → output layer (10 neurons for digits 0–9).
* **Training:** Show many images → compute loss (e.g., cross-entropy) → backpropagate → update weights.
* **Outcome:** The network learns internal representations (edges, strokes) enabling digit prediction.

---

## 🔁 Sequence Models — When to use them

Use sequence models when data is **ordered**:

* Natural language (sentences, paragraphs)
* Audio (speech)
* Time series (finance, sensors)
* Gesture streams, music generation

---

## 🔁 RNN — Recurrent Neural Network

* Designed to handle **sequential data** by maintaining a hidden state (memory) across time steps.
* Each time step input updates the hidden state; the hidden state passes to the next step → captures short-term dependencies.
* **Limitations:** Struggles with long-term dependencies due to **vanishing / exploding gradients**.

### RNN Architectures by I/O pattern

* **One-to-One:** Standard feedforward (not sequential).
* **One-to-Many:** One input → sequence output (e.g., music generation).
* **Many-to-One:** Sequence input → single output (e.g., sentiment classification).
* **Many-to-Many:** Sequence → sequence (e.g., machine translation).

---

## 🧠 LSTM — Long Short-Term Memory

* LSTM is an RNN variant designed to **capture long-term dependencies** using gated memory cells.
* **Key components (gates):**

  * **Input gate:** controls new information added to cell state.
  * **Forget gate:** decides what information to discard from cell state.
  * **Output gate:** decides what part of cell state to output as hidden state.
* LSTM keeps a **cell state** that flows through time; gates modulate it to remember/forget selectively.
* Works well for long sequences (language modeling, speech recognition, time-series forecasting).

---

## 🔄 How LSTM Processes a Sequence (step-by-step)

1. Receive current input vector + previous hidden & cell states.
2. Compute forget, input, and output gate activations.
3. Update cell state (forget old info + add new candidate info).
4. Compute new hidden state (based on cell state and output gate).
5. Pass hidden state to next time step.

---

## 🛠️ Practical Notes — Training & Scaling

## 💡 Demonstration: Deep Learning Classifier — “make_circles” Example

### 🎲 Dataset Generation

* Using **`sklearn.datasets.make_circles`** to create concentric circular data points.
* **Parameters:**

  * `n_samples=300` → total 300 points (150 per class)
  * `noise=0.1` → adds randomness
  * `factor=0.5` → distance between inner & outer circle
  * `random_state` → ensures reproducibility

### 🔍 Purpose

To visualize **how neural network complexity (neurons per layer)** affects the ability to separate non-linear data.

## 🧠 Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Demonstration

| Hidden Neurons  | Observation                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
