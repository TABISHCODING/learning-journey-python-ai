## 🧠 Module: Machine Learning Foundations

### 🎯 Objective

Learn the **core concepts of Machine Learning (ML)** — what it is, how it works, and explore the main categories: **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning**, with a focus on **Linear Regression** as the first supervised learning model.

---

## 🧩 1. Introduction to Machine Learning

### 📘 What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a **subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that enables computers to **learn from data** and make predictions or decisions **without explicit programming**.

> 🧠 ML = Algorithms + Data → Model → Predictions

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input (Features):** The data or attributes used to make predictions (e.g., size of house).
2. **Output (Label):** The expected result (e.g., house price).
3. **Training:** The model learns the relationship between features and labels.
4. **Inference:** The trained model predicts output for new data.

### 💡 Everyday Examples

## 🧮 2. How Machine Learning Works (Example: Cat vs Dog)

### 🐱 Example: Classifying Animals

1. Provide **input data (features)** — e.g., color, texture, eye color.
2. Provide **labels** — e.g., *cat* or *dog*.
3. Train the model using these examples.
4. Once trained, the model can predict labels for **new unseen data**.

### 🧠 Key Terms

## 🧩 5. Supervised Learning (In-Depth)

### 📘 Definition

Supervised learning trains a model using **labeled data** — meaning both **inputs (features)** and **outputs (labels)** are known.
The goal is to learn the **mapping** between inputs and outputs.

> 🎓 Analogy: Like a teacher guiding a student with correct answers during training.

---

## 🏡 6. Example: Predicting House Prices

### 📈 Problem Statement

Predict the **price of a house** based on its **size (sq. ft.)**.

| Feature (Input)      | Label (Output)  |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| House size (sq. ft.) | House price ($) |

### 🧩 Relationship

* As house size increases → price tends to increase.
* Represent this relationship as a **line** on a scatter plot.

---

## 📐 7. Linear Regression (Supervised Learning Model)

### 📘 Concept

Linear Regression finds a **best-fit straight line** that describes the relationship between **input (x)** and **output (y)**.

**Equation:**
[
f(x) = w \cdot x + b
]
Where:

* ( w ): **Slope (weight)** → how much output changes with input
* ( b ): **Intercept (bias)** → where the line crosses the y-axis

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Model Training:**

   * The algorithm adjusts ( w ) and ( b ) so that predictions are close to actual values.
2. **Error (Loss):**

   * Difference between predicted and actual output.
3. **Loss Function:**

   * Squared error = ((y_{pred} - y_{actual})^2)
4. **Optimization:**

   * Iteratively update ( w ) and ( b ) to minimize the loss (using gradient descent).

---

### 📊 Visual Understanding

* **Slope (w):** Controls tilt of the line.
* **Bias (b):** Moves the line up or down.
* **Goal:** Find the line that passes as close as possible to all data points (minimizing total error).

---

## 🧮 8. Model Usage (Prediction Phase)

Once the model is trained:

1. Give it new input (e.g., house size = 1100 sq. ft.)
2. Model uses learned function ( f(x) ) to **predict price**.

✅ Example:
If the line equation is ( f(x) = 150x + 10000 ),
then for ( x = 1100 ):
Predicted price = ( 150×1100 + 10000 = $175,000 )

---

### 📘 What is Classification?

* In **supervised learning**, the model learns from **labeled data** (input–output pairs).
* If the **output** is:

  * **Continuous → Regression**
  * **Categorical → Classification**

**Definition:**

> Classification is a supervised ML technique used to categorize or assign data points into predefined classes based on their features or attributes.

**Examples:**

* **Binary Classification:** Spam detection → (Spam / Not Spam)
* **Multi-class Classification:** Sentiment Analysis → (Positive / Negative / Neutral)

---

### ⚙️ Logistic Regression — The Core Classifier

* A simple yet powerful algorithm for **binary classification** problems.
* Predicts probabilities of outcomes (True/False or Yes/No).
* Uses an **S-shaped curve** called the **sigmoid function** to map inputs between 0 and 1.

#### 🧩 Example: Pass or Fail Prediction

| Feature (Input) | Output (Label) |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Hours of Study  | Pass / Fail    |

* The **sigmoid function** outputs a probability between 0 and 1.
* If probability > 0.5 → **Pass**
  If probability < 0.5 → **Fail**

**Sigmoid Function:**
[
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
]

* Example:

  * Student studies **6 hours → 0.8 probability → Pass**
  * Student studies **4 hours → 0.2 probability → Fail**

* Learn about **data preprocessing, training, testing, evaluation, and prediction**
* Use **Anaconda + Jupyter Notebook** for practical ML development

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow Overview

A typical **machine learning process** involves the following stages:

1. **📥 Load Data** – Import and read data into a DataFrame.
2. **🧹 Preprocess Data** – Clean, normalize, and split data into features and labels.
3. **🧠 Train Model** – Fit the machine learning model on training data.
4. **📊 Evaluate Model** – Test the model’s performance on unseen data.
5. **🔮 Make Predictions** – Use the trained model to predict outcomes.

---

## 🧩 Part 1: Implementing Logistic Regression (Basic Demo)

### Step 1️⃣ — Import Necessary Libraries

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

* **`pandas`**: For data manipulation (DataFrames & Series).
* **`sklearn.linear_model`**: Provides the `LogisticRegression` classifier.

> 💡 If these libraries are not available, install them via terminal:

```bash
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
```

---

### Step 2️⃣ — Load the Dataset

```python
# Load the dataset
iris_data = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")

# Display the first few rows
iris_data.head()
```

**Dataset:** `iris.csv`
Contains attributes of 3 Iris flower species — *Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica*.

| ID | SepalLength | SepalWidth | PetalLength | PetalWidth | Species     |
| -- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1  | 5.1         | 3.5        | 1.4         | 0.2        | Iris-setosa |

> `head()` is used to preview and understand data structure.

---

### Step 3️⃣ — Split Data into Features & Labels

```python
# Separate features (X) and labels (y)
X = iris_data.drop(['ID', 'Species'], axis=1)
y = iris_data['Species']
```

* **Features (X):** Sepal & petal measurements
* **Labels (y):** Species name
* **Dropped:** `ID` column — not useful for training

---

### Step 4️⃣ — Create & Train the Model

```python
# Initialize logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y)
```

> The model learns relationships between input features and the target label (species).

---

### Step 5️⃣ — Make Predictions

```python
# Predict species for new data points
new_data = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]
prediction = model.predict(new_data)

print("Predicted Species:", prediction)
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Species: ['Iris-setosa']
```

✅ **Workflow Summary:**

* Loaded dataset
* Split into X and y
* Trained logistic regression model
* Made and printed predictions

---

## 🧩 Part 2: Extended Demo – Full Workflow (With Preprocessing & Evaluation)

### Step 1️⃣ — Setup New Notebook

* Duplicate your existing notebook → rename as **`MLDemo2.ipynb`**
* Restart the kernel and **clear outputs**
* Import additional libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

---

### Step 2️⃣ — Understand the New Libraries

| Library              | Purpose                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **NumPy (`np`)**     | Efficient numerical computations           |
| **train_test_split** | Split dataset into training & test subsets |
| **StandardScaler**   | Normalize features (mean = 0, std = 1)     |
| **accuracy_score**   | Measure model performance                  |

---

### 🧮 Why Standardization Matters

* Features with large numeric ranges (e.g., 1000–5000 sqft) can dominate learning.
* Standardization ensures all features contribute **equally** to model training.

**Formula:**
[
z = \frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}
]

> Makes every feature centered around 0 and scaled by its variance.

---

### 🧪 Step 3️⃣ — Split Dataset

```python
# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

* **`test_size=0.2`** → 20% data used for testing
* **`random_state=42`** → ensures reproducibility

---

### ⚖️ Step 4️⃣ — Standardize Features

```python
# Initialize StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit on training data & transform both sets
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

---

### 🧠 Step 5️⃣ — Train Logistic Regression Model

```python
# Initialize and train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

---

### 📈 Step 6️⃣ — Evaluate Model Performance

```python
# Make predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

**Output:**

```
Model Accuracy: 1.0
```

✅ Perfect accuracy (100%) — model predicted all test samples correctly.

---

### 🔮 Step 7️⃣ — Predict on New Data

```python
# Sample new data (sepal & petal features)
new_data = np.array([
    [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2],
    [6.2, 3.4, 5.4, 2.3],
    [5.9, 3.0, 5.1, 1.8]
])

# Standardize new data
new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Make predictions
new_predictions = model.predict(new_data_scaled)
print("Predicted Classes:", new_predictions)
```

**Output:**

```
Predicted Classes: ['Iris-setosa' 'Iris-virginica' 'Iris-setosa']
```

---

# 🧩 Lesson: Unsupervised Learning & Reinforcement Learning

*(Oracle AI Foundations — Structured Notes)*

---

## 🧠 Part 1: Unsupervised Machine Learning

### 🔍 What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where **no labeled outputs** are provided.
The algorithm **learns patterns and relationships** in data to group similar data points together.

#### 🎨 Example Analogy

* Imagine giving a child a box of LEGO pieces and asking them to group them.

  * They might group by **color**, **size**, or **shape** — based on patterns they observe.
* Similarly, an algorithm groups **unlabeled data** into clusters.

#### 🍎 Example: Fruits Basket

You have apples, bananas, and oranges.

* The algorithm groups:

  * Round, red fruits (apples) → one cluster
  * Long, yellow fruits (bananas) → another cluster
* Without being told explicitly — the algorithm discovers these groupings on its own.

---

### 📊 Clustering Concept

Clustering groups similar data points into clusters.

* Inside a cluster → data points are **more similar** to each other.
* Outside a cluster → data points are **less similar**.
* Points that don’t belong anywhere → **outliers**.

**Example:** Grapes differ from apples and pears → identified as an **outlier**.

---

### 💼 Common Use Cases of Unsupervised Learning

| Use Case                         | Description                                   | Example                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🛍 **Market Segmentation**       | Grouping customers based on purchase behavior | Customers buying protein-rich products → show them sports ads      |
| 💳 **Outlier / Fraud Detection** | Detecting unusual patterns                    | Banks detect fraud from unusually high or recurring transactions   |
| 🎬 **Recommendation Systems**    | Suggesting content based on preferences       | Netflix groups users by movie types → personalized recommendations |

---

### 📏 Understanding Similarity

Similarity = how **close** two data points are to each other (value between **0 and 1**).

* Higher value → more similar.
* Example: Apple 🍎 and Cherry 🍒 → high similarity (closer to 1) because both are red and round.

---

### ⚙️ Workflow of Unsupervised Learning

| Step                              | Description                                                                                                                    |

| **2. Create Similarity Matrix**   | Calculate distances/similarities between data points                                                                           |
| **3. Choose Similarity Metric**   | Common metrics: <br> - Euclidean Distance <br> - Manhattan Distance <br> - Cosine Similarity <br> - Jaccard Similarity         |
| **4. Run Clustering Algorithm**   | Algorithms: <br> - Partition-based (K-Means) <br> - Hierarchical <br> - Density-based (DBSCAN) <br> - Distribution-based (GMM) |
| **5. Interpret & Refine Results** | Check quality → compare against expectations <br> Adjust preprocessing or parameters iteratively                               |

---

## 🤖 Part 2: Reinforcement Learning

### 🦴 What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is like **training a dog with rewards and penalties**.

* The agent learns **by interacting with the environment**.
* It receives **rewards** or **penalties** based on its actions.
* No labeled data is used.

---

### 💡 Real-World Applications

| Domain                        | Example                                                                  |

### 🧩 Key Reinforcement Learning Concepts

| Term            | Definition                           | Example                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Agent**       | Learner or decision-maker            | The car’s driving AI system               |
| **Environment** | The world the agent interacts with   | The road and surroundings                 |
| **State**       | Current situation of the environment | Camera view of the road                   |
| **Action**      | Move or decision the agent can take  | Turn left, right, or go straight          |
| **Reward**      | Feedback signal for an action        | +1 for staying on track, -1 for drifting  |
| **Policy**      | Strategy that maps states → actions  | “If curve detected → turn right slightly” |

---

### 🐶 Analogy: Training a Dog

* Dog = **Agent**
* Training ground = **Environment**
* Commands = **Actions**
* Rewards for obeying = **Positive Reward**
* Scolding for mistakes = **Penalty**

Over time, the dog learns a **policy** — what to do to maximize rewards.

---

### 🧭 Goal of Reinforcement Learning

The goal is to find the **Optimal Policy** —
a strategy that yields **maximum cumulative rewards** for the agent.

**The agent learns through trial and error**, using algorithms like:

* **Q-Learning**
* **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**

---

### ⚙️ Example: Robotic Arm in Warehouse

Goal → Teach a robotic arm to pick and place goods efficiently.

**Steps:**

1. **Define Environment:**
   The warehouse, goods, and target shelves.
2. **Define States:**
   Arm’s position, object position, and target location.
3. **Define Actions:**
   Move arm left/right/up/down, pick up, place.
4. **Define Rewards:**
   ✅ Reward for placing correctly
   ❌ Penalty for dropping/damaging
5. **Training Process:**

   * Start randomly → explore various actions
   * Observe rewards/penalties
   * Gradually learn which actions maximize rewards
   * Result → Optimized strategy (optimal policy)
