## 🎨 **2. What Is Generative AI?**

**Definition:**
Generative AI models *learn patterns* in data and use them to **generate new, original outputs** (not copies).

**Example Analogy:**
Imagine teaching a model to draw a dog:

* You feed it thousands of dog images 🐶
* It learns patterns (ears, nose, fur texture)
* Then it generates a *new* dog image that doesn’t exist in the dataset

**Key Point:**
GenAI doesn’t *copy* — it *creates* based on learned structures and relationships.

## ⚙️ **3. How It Differs from Traditional Machine Learning**

| Aspect        | Traditional ML                                 | Generative AI                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**      | Learn from labeled data to predict or classify | Learn patterns to generate new content |
| **Data Type** | Structured and labeled                         | Unstructured and unlabeled             |
| **Output**    | Label or prediction                            | New content (text, image, audio, etc.) |
| **Examples**  | Spam detection, price prediction               | Text generation, image creation        |

**Simplified View:**

* ML → *“Recognize patterns and predict.”*
* GenAI → *“Understand patterns and create.”*

## 🎓 **Module: Large Language Models (LLMs)**

### 🧩 Lesson Overview

In this lesson, you will learn:

1. What a **Language Model** is
2. How **Large Language Models (LLMs)** work
3. How LLMs generate text using probabilities
4. Common **applications of LLMs**
5. LLM architecture and scale

---

## 🧠 **1. What Is a Language Model?**

**Definition:**
A language model (LM) is a **probabilistic model** of text that predicts the likelihood of a word sequence based on preceding words.

**Example:**
Sentence: “I wrote to the zoo to send me a pet. They sent me ___.”

* LM predicts the next word by assigning probabilities to options:

  * Lion → 0.03
  * Elephant → 0.02
  * Dog → 0.45 ✅

**Key Points:**

* LMs work within a **vocabulary** relevant to the context.
* Words outside the vocabulary are not considered.
* The model chooses the **highest probability word** and appends it to the sentence iteratively.

---

## ⚙️ **2. How LLMs Generate Text**

1. **Tokenization**: Text is split into smaller units (words, subwords, or characters).
2. **Probability Computation**: Each token gets a probability for its likelihood to appear next.
3. **Word Selection**: Highest probability token is chosen.
4. **Sequence Update**: Chosen token is appended to the input, and probabilities are recalculated for the next token.
5. **End-of-Sequence (EOS)**: Model stops generation when EOS token has highest probability.

**Example:**
Input → “They sent me ___”

* LLM predicts → Dog → Append → “They sent me dog”
* Next token = EOS → Generation ends

---

## 📝 **3. Key Features of LLMs**

| Feature           | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Large**         | Refers to the number of parameters (weights) in the model.         |
| **Parameters**    | Adjustable weights optimized during training to predict next word. |
| **Scale**         | From hundreds of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters.   |
| **Architecture**  | Based on **Transformers** for attention over sequences.            |
| **Training Data** | Massive text datasets from public sources (web, books, articles).  |

**Note:** Larger models don’t always mean better performance; too many parameters may cause overfitting.

---

## 🧩 **4. Applications of LLMs**

| Task                     | Example                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Question Answering**   | “What is the capital of France?” → “Paris” |
| **Text Generation**      | Essays, articles, stories                  |
| **Language Translation** | “How are you?” → French: “Comment ça va ?” |
| **Reasoning & Puzzles**  | Solve logic or math problems               |
| **Conversational AI**    | Chatbots and dialogue systems              |

**Summary:**
LLMs can understand context and generate coherent, context-aware outputs across a wide range of tasks.

---

## 🔍 **5. How LLMs Work Internally**

1. **Transformer Architecture**: Allows selective attention to relevant words in the input.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Each word prediction considers all previous words.
3. **Deep Neural Network**: Millions to billions of parameters encode patterns in language.
4. **Probabilistic Output**: Model predicts next word based on learned probabilities.

---

## 🧭 **6. Key Takeaways**

* LLMs are **probabilistic models** that predict sequences of words.
* “Large” refers to **model size and parameters**, not necessarily performance.
* LLMs are **transformer-based deep neural networks**, trained on massive text corpora.

3. Concepts of **tokens, embeddings, and self-attention**
4. Different **transformer model types**: encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder
5. Applications in **RAG, semantic search, and text generation**

---

## 🧠 **1. Limitations of RNNs for Language Understanding**

**RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)**

* Designed for sequential data (text, time-series)
* Maintain **hidden state** (memory) to capture dependencies
* Process input **one element at a time**
* Struggle with **long sequences** due to:

  * Vanishing gradient

**Example:**
Sentence: “Jane threw the Frisbee and her dog fetched it.”

* Human: Understands “it” refers to Frisbee
* RNN: Only knows nearby words; struggles with long-range relationships

---

## ⚡ **2. Transformer Architecture**

**Key Advantage:**

* Transformers can **look at all words simultaneously** (bird’s eye view)
* Capture **long-range dependencies** using **self-attention**

**Self-Attention Mechanism:**

* Adds **context** to each word
* Weighs importance of all words relative to each token
* Allows the model to resolve references like “it” → Frisbee

**Architecture:**

* Introduced in **“Attention Is All You Need”** (2017)
* Composed of:

  1. **Encoder** – encodes input text into vector representations (embeddings)
  2. **Decoder** – generates output text token by token

---

## 🧩 **3. Tokens and Tokenization**

**Tokens:**

* Unit of text understood by LLMs
* Can be:

  * Full word (apple)
  * Part of a word (friend + ship = friendship)
  * Punctuation (comma, period)

**Tokenization Example:**

* “They sent me a dog.” → 5 tokens: They | sent | me | a | dog

---

## 🧩 **4. Embeddings**

**Definition:**

* Numerical vector representation of tokens or text
* Encodes semantic and contextual meaning
* Can represent:

  * Words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs

**Usage:**

* Input text → Tokenization → Encoder → Vector embeddings
* Embeddings used for:

  * **Semantic search**
  * **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
  * Classification, clustering, or other downstream tasks

**RAG Example:**

1. Encode a corpus of documents into vectors
2. Encode user query
3. Compare query vector with document vectors
4. Retrieve most relevant documents for LLM to generate informed answers

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Encoder-only**    | Transforms input to vectors, no sequence generation | Semantic search, vector DB, classification    |
| **Decoder-only**    | Generates text token by token                       | Text generation, articles, chatbots           |
| **Encoder-Decoder** | Encodes input → generates output                    | Sequence-to-sequence tasks, e.g., translation |

**How Decoder Works:**

* Receives sequence of tokens
* Emits **one token at a time** based on probabilities
* Each new token is fed back for the next prediction

**How Encoder-Decoder Works:**

* Encoder → embeds input sequence into vectors
* Decoder → generates output sequence token by token
* Self-referential loop continues until full sequence generated

---

## 🔍 **6. Key Takeaways**

* RNNs have **limitations with long-range dependencies**
* Transformers use **self-attention** to capture context across entire sequences
* LLMs operate on **tokens**, not raw words
* **Embeddings** are crucial for understanding semantic meaning
* Transformers come in **encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder variants**
* Applications include **RAG, semantic search, text generation, translation**

---

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

Transformers are **the backbone of modern LLMs**.

* Encoder modules: understand and embed input
* Decoder modules: generate output one token at a time
* Variants are tailored for different tasks: understanding, generation, or both

In the **next lesson**, you will explore **prompts and prompt engineering**, the key to interacting effectively with LLMs.
