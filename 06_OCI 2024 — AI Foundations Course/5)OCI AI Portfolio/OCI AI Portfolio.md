## üß† **1. Responsible AI**

**Why it matters:**

* AI is increasingly used in daily work (e.g., self-driving cars, AI-driven healthcare)
* Trustworthy AI must satisfy: **lawful, ethical, and robust** principles

**Key Principles:**

| Principle   | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lawful**  | Compliance with applicable laws and regulations (national & international, domain-specific)    |
| **Ethical** | Adherence to human values, human dignity, freedom, privacy, equality, and democratic processes |
| **Robust**  | Technically reliable, secure, resilient, and socially responsible; minimize unintentional harm |

**Human-Centric Design:**

* Respect **human dignity** and **freedom of choice**
* Maintain **democratic processes**
* Ensure **fairness**, **transparency**, and **explainability**

**Ethical Implementation in AI:**

* **Human oversight:** AI should assist humans, not replace judgment
* **Safety & security:** Systems should be robust and protected against misuse
* **Fairness:** Prevent bias, discrimination, and ensure equitable benefits
* **Explainability:** Decisions should be understandable to affected parties

**Implementation Process:**

1. Establish **governance**
2. Develop **policies & procedures**
3. Ensure **compliance** via monitoring and evaluation

**Challenges in AI (Healthcare Example):**

* **Bias in data:** Models may underperform for underrepresented groups
* **Explainability:** Complex models make decisions hard to trust
* **Ongoing evaluation:** Ensure AI performs as intended and avoids harm
