# 🎓 Learning Journey: Python, AI & Generative AI Development

Welcome to my **Learning Journey Repository**, documenting my path from Python fundamentals to building **AI-powered and Generative AI applications** through Microsoft and IBM courses.

Each folder represents one course and is further divided into modules containing:
- 📘 **Concept Notes** (theory, code explanations)
- 💬 **Q&A Notes** (practice questions, exercises, revision points)
- 🚀 **Projects** (mini or major projects)
